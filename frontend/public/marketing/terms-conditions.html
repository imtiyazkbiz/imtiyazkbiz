                  this Agreement or use of the Site. HOT's performance of this
                  Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and
                  nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of HOT's
                  right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement
                  requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or
                  information provided to or gathered by HOT with respect to
                  such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be
                  invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including,
                  but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability
                  limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
                  provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable
                  provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
                  provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in
                  effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this Agreement
                  constitutes the entire agreement between the User and HOT with
                  respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or
                  contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                  electronic, oral or written, between the User and HOT with
                  respect to the Site. A printed version of this Agreement and
                  of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
                  judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating
                  to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same
                  conditions as other business documents and records originally
                  generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express
                  wish to the parties that this Agreement and all related
                  documents be written in English.
                </p>
